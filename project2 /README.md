# Project 1 — Clinic FAQ Copilot
**Goal:** Answer common clinic questions from a small knowledge base.

## Plan
- Collect 10–20 FAQs into a single doc.
- Build a simple interface (notebook or form) that queries the doc via an LLM.
- Record a 3-min Loom demo.

## Test set
- 10 questions with expected answers.

## Limits & handoff
- List cases that must escalate to a human; add a short checklist.
